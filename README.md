 üõí Retail Orders Data Analysis & ETL

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and SQL to analyze retail order data. The analysis includes revenue trends, product performance, category insights, and customer segments. 

Technologies used:
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy)**
- **SQL**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## üîÑ ETL Process

### 1. **Extract**
Data is read from a cleaned CSV file and validated using Python (Pandas).

### 2. **Transform**
Unnecessary columns are dropped, missing values are handled, and data is formatted for SQL compatibility.

### 3. **Load**
Transformed data is loaded into an SQLite database, where queries are used for insight generation.
